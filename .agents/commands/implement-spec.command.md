# implement-spec

The goal of this command is to take an existing validated spec and implement it.

- Read the specification and spawn a new **Builder** sub-agent to run the [`/planify`](/.agents/skills/planify/SKILL.md) skill once per affected container. For a functional spec, one more run for the `e2e` suite. Do this phase in parallel; ie, spawn as many sub-agents as there are affected containers.

- _ONCE_ all the sub-agents have finished, spawn a new **Builder** sub-agent to run the [`/codify`](/.agents/skills/codify/SKILL.md) skill to write the code (with unit tests) of each plan.  Do this phase in parallel; ie, spawn as many sub-agents as there are plans to codify.


- _ONCE_ all the sub-agents have finished, spawn a new **Craftsman** sub-agent to review the implementation by running [`/review-implementation`](./review-implementation.command.md) command with the implementation in hand.
