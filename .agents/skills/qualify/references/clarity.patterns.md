# Code-clarity lens

Prefer clarity over cleverness, and match the project's rules. Every match is a finding under the [clean code gate](./qualify.gates.md).

## Principles

- Clarity over cleverness — explicit beats compact when compact needs a mental pause.
- Preserve behavior — same inputs, outputs, side effects, ordering, and errors.
- Convention over preference — match project rules and neighboring code.
- Judge what changed — but a new symbol that reimplements an existing one is still a finding.
- Chesterton's fence — understand why code exists before proposing its removal.

## Structural patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Deep nesting (3+ levels) | hard-to-follow control flow | guard clauses or helpers |
| Long function (50+ lines) | many responsibilities | split into named functions |
| Nested ternary | needs a mental stack to parse | if/else, switch, or lookup |
| Boolean flag params | `f(true, false)` at call sites | options object or split functions |
| Repeated conditional | same check in many places | one named predicate |

## Naming and readability

| Pattern | Signal | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Generic name | `data`, `tmp`, `val`, `item` | name for the content |
| Abbreviation | `usr`, `cfg`, `btn`, `evt` | full word unless universal (`id`, `url`) |
| Misleading name | `get` that also mutates | rename to actual behavior |
| "What" comment | `// increment` over `i++` | delete; the code is clear |
| "Why" comment | intent the code can't express | keep it |

## Redundancy

| Pattern | Signal | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Duplicated logic | same 5+ lines repeated | extract a shared function |
| Dead code | unused vars, unreachable branches | remove after confirming |
| Needless wrapper | adds no value | inline it |
| Over-engineering | factory-for-a-factory | the direct approach |
| Redundant assertion | cast to an already-inferred type | remove it |

## Out of scope (not a finding)

- Removing error handling to look cleaner.
- Renames to personal taste over project convention.
- Over-inlining that removes a useful named concept.
- Line-count wins that hurt comprehension.
